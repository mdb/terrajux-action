# terrajux-action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for executing [terrajux](https://github.com/rhenning/terrajux).

## TODO

* more robust tests
* research the use of [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) rather than tasking `terrajux` to `git clone`
* provide users the ability to pass options (`subpath`, `v2ref`, etc.)
* experimental: research techniques for exiting nonzero based on "policy" violations
